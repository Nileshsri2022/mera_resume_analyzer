## 🚀 Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd resume-analyzer
```

### 2. Install System Dependencies

#### Windows
1.  **Poppler**:
    *   Download the latest binary from [Poppler for Windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/).
    *   Extract the zip file.
    *   Add the `bin` folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\poppler-xx\bin`) to your System **PATH**.
2.  **Tesseract**:
    *   Download the installer from [UB-Mannheim Tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
    *   Run the installer and complete the setup.
    *   Add the installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`) to your System **PATH**.

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils tesseract-ocr libtesseract-dev
```

#### macOS
```bash
brew install poppler tesseract
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies
We recommend using `uv` for faster and more reliable package management, but `pip` works as well.

**Using `uv` (Recommended):**
```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
pip install uv

# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Using `pip`:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate venv (same as above)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

```env
# Required for AI Analysis
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

# Optional: For OpenAI integration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Optional: For database configuration (defaults to local SQLite)
DB_PATH=resume_database.db
```
